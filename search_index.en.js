The first one soon will be obesolate, and we should start using the comprehensive method to change how the Open edX looks. The existing documentation for this comprehensive theme is quite good enough but not yet give some clue to newcomer like me to activate the theme (per this post is written).\nMy post here mostly takes from Open edX documentation here and here, plus my experience when developing a theme for IndonesiaX.\nComprehensive Theming, like the documentation said, it lets us to customize the appearance of our Open edX installation. We can override Sass/CSS, images, or entire HTML templates. In this guide, i will be using Open edX eucalyptus as code base.\nCreating the Theme\nTheme Structure\nA theme is a directory of assets. The top directory is our theme name. I use starter-theme as our example. The structure theme here, basicly must mimic the edx-platform theme structure. Files that we create on our theme here will overwrite the default files in edx-platform repo. So the concept is, if you want override something, just copy the default files from edx-platform repo to our theme, and start making changes from copied files.\nHere is the example file structure :\n\nHTML Templates\nAs i said above, if want to make changes on html templates, just copy the default files, paste it to our theme templates folder and make some changes from there. Just take some notes, if we upgrade our Open edX to newer version, we may must refactor our custom template to using new Open edX templates.\nSASS/CSS\nStyling in Open edX is done with Sass and then compiled to CSS. We can override the default style or add new css rules, by just mimic the file name in edx-platform/lms/static/sass/ folder. If we want to make some changes/add in css, here is the main sass file that i recommend to override:\n\nFor example, if we just want to override main style, just create file named lms-main-v1.scss on our theme sass folder and _overrides.scss for our simple custom sass, then add this line of code on top of the file:\n\nImport the original styles corresponding to sass file we overwrite.\nImages\nIf you want to replace images, just mimic the file name on edx-platform repo, and put it on folder images as structure above. If you want to add new images assets, put it there too.\nHere is the example code to call the images assets on our HTML templates:\n\nOr if you want to call it via CSS, write it like this:\n\nActivating the Theme\nTo use our new theme, we must configure some value and update the assets. Here is the steps:\n\n\nCreate folder themes on /edx/app/edxapp/\n\n\nPut our new theme on that folder. So for this example our theme location will be /edx/app/edxapp/themes/starter-theme\n\n\nMake some changes in lms.env.json located in /edx/app/edxapp/. Then change some variables to this:\n\n\n\nUpdate the assets.\n\n*p.s. If you are in development, i recommend you adding --debug on command paver. This will compile the css to extended style and showing you the compile process in terminal, so you can debug your code when it failed to compile.\n\n\nRestart the lms instance.\n\n\n\nThats it.\nIf you just want to test out this comprehensive theming, i had create a github repo for you to clone here:\nhttps://github.com/dehamzah/starter-theme-openedx\nI also create a simple bash script to update the assets on my gist here.\nIf you have some issues just comments below, maybe i can help or maybe other readers can help too.\np.s. What if i already follow all these steps above but my Open edX theme still not changed?\nTry to login to django admin on /admin with superuser account.\nThen go to Theming &gt; Site Themes : /admin/theming/sitetheme/.\nIn there add site theme, and put your theme name there.\nIf you already compile your assets, you can try refreshing your Open edX homepage, it should be changed now.\n\nNote: I'm no longer developing open edx theme, if you have question, you should go to open edx slack channel.\n","id":"https://dehamzah.com/blog/comprehensive-theming-on-open-edx/","title":"Comprehensive Theming on Open edX"},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/how-https-works/":{"body":"What is HTTPS?\n\nHypertext Transfer Protocol Secure: Secure version of HTTP for safe data transfer between browser and website.\nUses SSL/TLS to encrypt data, verify website identity, and ensure data integrity.\n\nHow HTTPS Works (Step-by-Step)\n\n\nStarting the Connection\n\nEnter https://example.com → Browser connects to website’s server (port 443).\n\"S\" in HTTPS means secure, using encryption.\n\n\n\nSSL/TLS Handshake (Setting Up Security)\n\nServer sends certificate: Contains server’s public key and identity info.\nBrowser verifies certificate: Checks if it’s valid, not expired, and from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).\nSession key creation: Browser creates a random session key, encrypts it with server’s public key, and sends it.\nServer decrypts: Uses its private key to get the session key.\nResult: Both now share a secret session key for fast, symmetric encryption.\n\n\n\nSecure Data Transfer\n\nBrowser and server use the session key to encrypt/decrypt data (e.g., passwords, web pages).\nData is unreadable to eavesdroppers (e.g., hackers on public Wi-Fi).\nIntegrity check: Hashing ensures data isn’t tampered with during transfer.\n\n\n\nOngoing Communication\n\nSecure exchange continues until you leave the site.\nEach session gets a new session key for security.\n\n\n\nKey Concepts to Remember\n\n\nSSL/TLS:\n\nSSL (Secure Sockets Layer): Old protocol, replaced by TLS (Transport Layer Security).\nProvides:\n\nEncryption: Scrambles data so only intended recipient can read it.\nAuthentication: Verifies website is legit (not a fake).\nIntegrity: Ensures data isn’t altered in transit.\n\n\n\n\n\nCertificates:\n\nIssued by CAs to prove website identity.\nContains public key and domain details.\nBrowser trusts CAs to confirm site is genuine.\n\n\n\nEncryption Types:\n\nAsymmetric: Uses public/private key pair for handshake (slower, secure for key exchange).\nSymmetric: Uses shared session key for faster data transfer.\n\n\n\nWhy HTTPS Matters:\n\nProtects sensitive info (e.g., logins, credit cards).\nPrevents man-in-the-middle attacks (someone intercepting data).\nBuilds trust: Browsers warn “Not Secure” for non-HTTPS sites.\nBoosts website SEO.\n\n\n\nMemory Aids\n\nHTTPS = HTTP + Security: Think “S” for “Safe.”\nHandshake = Trust Setup: Like exchanging a secret code before talking.\nCertificate = Website ID: Like a driver’s license for a website.\nSession Key = Secret Handshake: A temporary code only you and the server know.\nEncryption = Scrambling: Turns your data into gibberish without the key.\n\nExample to Visualize\n\nYou visit https://yourbank.com:\n\nBrowser asks server for a secure connection.\nServer shows its “ID card” (certificate).\nBrowser checks ID with a trusted authority (CA).\nYou and server agree on a secret code (session key).\nAll data (e.g., your login) is sent scrambled, safe from hackers.\n\n\n\n","id":"https://dehamzah.com/blog/how-https-works/","title":"How HTTPS Works"},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/skip-docker-desktop-use-colima-and-lazydocker-instead/":{"body":"Docker Desktop is great—but if you're using it at work, you might be paying more than you need to.\nSince Docker changed its licensing, companies with over 250 employees or $10M revenue must pay $9/user/month. For a 20-person dev team, that’s $2,160/year—just to run containers locally.\nEnter Colima\nColima is a free, open-source alternative that runs Docker containers on macOS using Lima VMs.\nHow Colima Works\nColima uses Lima under the hood to run a lightweight Linux virtual machine on your Mac. Inside this VM, Colima sets up Docker (or containerd) so you can run containers just like you would with Docker Desktop.\nWhen you use the Docker CLI (docker run, docker compose, etc.), your commands are sent to the Docker daemon running inside the Colima-managed VM. Colima handles networking, file sharing, and resource allocation between your Mac and the VM, making the experience seamless.\nKey points:\n\nIsolation: Containers run inside a Linux VM, not directly on macOS.\nIntegration: Docker CLI and Compose work out of the box.\nPerformance: Colima is fast and uses fewer resources than Docker Desktop.\nCustomization: You can easily adjust CPU, memory, and disk settings for the VM.\n\nThis architecture lets you use Docker on macOS without the overhead or licensing restrictions.\nInstallation and usage\n\nConfigure Colima VM Spec\nSometime you need to specify more VM Spec to Colima so that you can run more containers.\n\nNext time you start with colima start it will remember the last configuration, you can verify it with command colima list.\nNeed a UI? Use Lazydocker\nMissing Docker Desktop’s dashboard? Try Lazydocker — a terminal UI to manage containers, images, volumes, and logs.\nInstallation and usage in Mac OS:\n\nConclusion\nIf you're using Docker Desktop for work, switching to Colima + Lazydocker can save money without sacrificing functionality.\nBut if only for personal use, Docker Desktop is fine.\n","id":"https://dehamzah.com/blog/skip-docker-desktop-use-colima-and-lazydocker-instead/","title":"Skip Docker Desktop — Use Colima (and Lazydocker) Instead"}},"docInfo":{"https://dehamzah.com/":{"body":16,"title":1},"https://dehamzah.com/about/":{"body":106,"title":0},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/comprehensive-theming-on-open-edx/":{"body":395,"title":4},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/how-https-works/":{"body":315,"title":2},"https://dehamzah.com/blog/skip-docker-desktop-use-colima-and-lazydocker-instead/":{"body":207,"title":7}},"length":6},"lang":"English"}
